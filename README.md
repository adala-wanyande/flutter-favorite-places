# Favorite Places

## Overview

Favorite Places is a Flutter application designed to let users capture and save their most cherished locations along with a picture and details. Leveraging the power of Google Maps API, the app allows users to pinpoint exact locations on a map, enriching the personal value of each saved place. It integrates native device features such as the camera for a more interactive and seamless user experience. The app employs Riverpod for state management, ensuring a responsive and efficient user interface. Data persistence is achieved through an SQL database, allowing users to store and retrieve their favorite places anytime, ensuring their precious memories are always at hand.
